## Overview
- Designing and implementing a robotic arm to lift and displace upto 100g of weight.
- This project simulates a robotic arm using **Three.js** with STL file models and allows real-time manipulation of the arm's joints through buttons and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features
- **3D STL Models**: Interactive rendering of robotic arm parts (base, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand).
- **Keyboard Control**: Rotate parts of the arm using specific keys.
- **Real-time Updates**: Visualization of movement.

## Keyboard Control Shortcuts
