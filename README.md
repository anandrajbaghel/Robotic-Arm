## Overview
- Designing and implementing a robotic arm to lift and displace upto 100g of weight.
- This project simulates a robotic arm using **Three.js** with STL file models and allows real-time manipulation of the arm's joints through buttons and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features
- **3D STL Models**: Interactive rendering of robotic arm parts (base, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand).
- **Keyboard Control**: Rotate parts of the arm using specific keys.
- **Real-time Updates**: Visualization of movement.

## Key Updates:
1. **Button Style Controls**: For each key press, there is now a badge-style button using [shields.io](https://shields.io/) for a clean visual representation.
2. **Stylized Key Functions**: The table format presents keypresses in a more visually appealing way, improving the overall look and feel.
3. **Demo Button**: A visually prominent button to encourage users to try out the demo.
